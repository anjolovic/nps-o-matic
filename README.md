## Installation

This application is designed to run under Ruby 2.3.3. It utilizes the (webpacker)[https://github.com/rails/webpacker] gem, so a recent version of Node.js and Yarn are also required.

To setup the application, use the binstub:

```
./bin/setup
```

Once installed, you can run the application using:

```
rails server
```

And then load `http://0.0.0.0:3000` in your browser
